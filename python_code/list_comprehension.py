# List comprehension

 # [expression for item in iterable if condition]
    # 1) expression: expresion to evaluate and append to the new list
    # 2) item: The variable representing each element in the iterable (e.g., a list, tuple, or string).
    # 3) iterable: The sequence or iterable to iterate over
    # 4) condition (optional): An expression to filter elements based on a condition.
# A function to return all composers with 'v' in the name

# tuple
composers = "Beethoven", "Ravel", "Debussy", "Rachmaninoff", "Chopin", "von Weber"

# The return value is a new list, leaving the old list unchanged.

# The expression is the current item in the iteration but also the outcome which can #be manipulated before it is added to the new lists
# The condition is like a filter that only accepts the items that valuate to True.
